Spatial-Modulation-and-SSK-system
------------------------------------
Designed a Spatial Modulation and a SSK system and plotted their BER performance using Python
Observation: In SSK, we don't use a modulation scheme at the transmitter as is the case in Spatial modulation but rather use a fixed symbol over the antennas. We observe the classic waterfall diagram for BER vs SNR in spatial modulation and in SSK.
